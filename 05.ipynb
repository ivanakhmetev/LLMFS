We go over this topic step-by-step with a practical example to make the concepts clear and applicable, beginning with a short recap of how the data is loaded from chapter 2 and how the text is generated via the generate_text_simple function from chapter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5.4 illustrates the overall flow from input text to LLM-generated text using a five-step procedure.\n",
    "Figure 5.4 For each of the 3 input tokens, shown on the left, we compute a vector containing probability scores corresponding to each token in the vocabulary. The index position of the highest probability score in each vector represents the most likely next token ID. These token IDs associated with the highest probability scores are selected and mapped back into a text that represents the text generated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text generation process in Figure 5.4 outlines what the generate_text_simple function from chapter 4 does internally. We need to perform these same initial steps before we can compute a loss that measures the generated text quality later in this section.\n",

    "Figure 5.4 outlines the text generation process with a small 7-token vocabulary to fit this image on a single page. However, our GPTModel works with a much larger vocabulary consisting of 50,257 words; hence, the token IDs in the following codes will range from 0 to 50,256 rather than 0 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Figure 5.4 only shows a single text example (\"every effort moves\") for simplicity. In the following hands-on code example that implements the steps in Figure 5.4, we will work with two input examples (\"every effort moves\" and \"I really like\") as inputs for the GPT model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two input examples, which which have already been mapped to token IDs, corresponding to step 1 in Figure 5.4:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "inputs = torch.tensor([[16833, 3626, 6100],   # [\"every effort moves\",\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the targets are the inputs but shifted one position forward, a concept we covered chapter 2 during the implementation of the data loader. This shifting strategy is crucial for teaching the model to predict the next token in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we feed the inputs into the model to calculate logit vectors for the two input examples, each comprising three tokens, and apply the softmax function to transform these logit values into probability scores, which corresponds to step 2 in Figure 5.4:\n",

    "The first number, 2, corresponds to the two examples (rows) in the inputs, also known as batch size. The second number, 3, corresponds to the number of tokens in each input (row). Finally, the last number corresponds to the embedding dimensionality, which is determined by the vocabulary size, as discussed in previous chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the conversion from logits to probabilities via the softmax function, the generate_text_simple function from chapter 4 then converts the resulting probability scores back into text, as illustrated in steps 3-5 in Figure 5.4.\n",

    "The model produces random text that is different from the target text because it has not been trained yet. We now get to the part where we evaluate the performance of the model's generated text numerically via a so-called loss as illustrated in Figure 5.4. Not only is this useful for measuring the quality of the generated text, but it's also a building block for implementing the training function later, which we use to update the model's weight to improve the generated text.\n",

    "Part of the text evaluation process that we implement in the remainder of this section, as shown in Figure 5.5, is to measure \"how far\" the generated tokens are from the correct predictions (targets). The training function we implement later in this chapter will use this information to adjust the model weights to generate text that is more similar to (or ideally matches) the target text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model training aims to increase the softmax probability in the index positions corresponding to the correct target token IDs, as illustrated in Figure 5.6. This softmax probability is also used in the evaluation metric we are implementing in the remainder of this section to numerically assess the model's generated outputs: the higher the probability in the correct positions, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5.6 Before training, the model produces random next-token probability vectors. The goal of model training is to ensure that the probability values corresponding to the highlighted target token IDs are maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that Figure 5.6 displays the softmax probabilities for a compact 7-token vocabulary to fit everything into a single figure. This implies that the starting random values will hover around 1/7, which equals approximately 0.14.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the vocabulary we are using for our GPT-2 model has 50,257 tokens, so most of the initial probabilities will hover around 0.00002 via 1/50,257.\n",

    "\n",
    "he goal of training an LLM is to maximize these values, aiming to get them as close to a probability of 1. This way, we ensure the LLM consistently picks the target token—essentially the next word in the sentence—as the next token it generates.\n",
    "Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we maximize the softmax probability values corresponding to the target tokens? The big picture is that we update the model weights so that the model outputs higher values for the respective token IDs we want to generate. The weight update is done via a process called backpropagation, a standard technique for training deep neural networks (see sections A.3 to A.7 in Appendix A for more details about backpropagation and model training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation requires a loss function, which calculates the difference between the model's predicted output (here, the probabilities corresponding to the target token IDs) and the actual desired output. This loss function measures how far off the model's predictions are from the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this section, we calculate the loss for the probability scores of the two example batches, target_probas_1 and target_probas_2. The main steps are illustrated in Figure 5.7.\n",
    "Figure 5.7 Calculating the loss involves several steps. Steps 1 to 3 calculate the token probabilities corresponding to the target tensors. These probabilities are then transformed via a logarithm and averaged in steps 4-6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already applied steps 1-3 listed in Figure 5.7 to obtain target_probas_1 and target_probas_2, we proceed with step 4, applying the logarithm to the probability scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "log_probas = torch.log(torch.cat((target_probas_1, target_probas_2)))\n",
    "print(log_probas)\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "tensor([ -9.5042, -10.3796, -11.3677, -10.1308, -10.9951, -12.2561])\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with logarithms of probability scores is more manageable in mathematical optimization than handling the scores directly. This topic is outside the scope of this book, but I've detailed it further in a lecture, which is linked in the reference section in appendix B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we combine these log probabilities into a single score by computing the average (step 5 in Figure 5.7):\n",
    "\n",
    "avg_log_probas = torch.mean(log_probas)\n",
    "print(avg_log_probas)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "tensor(-10.7722)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to get the average log probability as close to 0 as possible by updating the model's weights as part of the training process, which we will implement later in section 5.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in deep learning, the common practice isn't to push the average log probability up to 0 but rather to bring the negative average log probability down to 0. The negative average log probability is simply the average log probability multiplied by -1, which corresponds to step 6 in Figure 5.7:\n",
    "\n",
    "neg_avg_log_probas = avg_log_probas * -1\n",
    "print(neg_avg_log_probas)\n",
    "\n",

    "This prints tensor(-10.7722).\n",
    "\n",
    "The term for this negative value, -10.7722 turning into 10.7722, is known as the cross entropy loss in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch comes in handy here, as it already has a built-in cross_entropy function that takes care of all these 6 steps in Figure 5.7 for us.\n",
    "Cross entropy loss\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the cross entropy loss is a popular measure in machine learning and deep learning that measures the difference between two probability distributions--typically, the true distribution of labels (here, tokens in a dataset) and the predicted distribution from a model (for instance, the token probabilities generated by an LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning and specifically in frameworks like PyTorch, the cross_entropy function computes this measure for discrete outcomes, which is similar to the negative average log probability of the target tokens given the model's generated token probabilities, making the terms cross entropy and negative average log probability related and often used interchangeably in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we apply the cross entropy function, let's briefly recall the shape of the logits and target tensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Logits shape:\", logits.shape)\n",
    "print(\"Targets shape:\", targets.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting shapes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logits shape: torch.Size([2, 3, 50257])\n",
    "Targets shape: torch.Size([2, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the logits tensor has three dimensions: batch size, number of tokens, and vocabulary size. The targets tensor has two dimensions: batch size and number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the cross entropy_loss function in PyTorch, we want to flatten these tensors by combining them over the batch dimension:\n",
    "\n",
    "logits_flat = logits.flatten(0, 1)\n",
    "targets_flat = targets.flatten()\n",
    "print(\"Flattened logits:\", logits_flat.shape)\n",
    "print(\"Flattened targets:\", targets_flat.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting tensor dimensions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattened logits: torch.Size([6, 50257])\n",
    "Flattened targets: torch.Size([6])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the targets are the token IDs we want the LLM to generate, and the logits contain the unscaled model outputs before they enter the softmax function to obtain the probability scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we applied the softmax function, selected the probability scores corresponding to the target IDs, and computed the negative average log probabilities. PyTorch's cross_entropy function will take care of all these steps for us:\n",

    "Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is a measure often used alongside cross entropy loss to evaluate the performance of models in tasks like language modeling. It can provide a more interpretable way to understand the uncertainty of a model in predicting the next token in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity measures how well the probability distribution predicted by the model matches the actual distribution of the words in the dataset. Similar to the loss, a lower perplexity indicates that the model predictions are closer to the actual distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity can be calculated as perplexity = torch.exp(loss), which returns tensor(47678.8633) when applied to the previously calculated loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is often considered more interpretable than the raw loss value because it signifies the effective vocabulary size about which the model is uncertain at each step. In the given example, this would translate to the model being unsure about which among 47,678 words or tokens in the vocabulary to generate as the next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we calculated the loss for two small text inputs for illustration purposes. In the next section, we apply the loss computation to the entire training and validation sets.\n",
    "5.1.3 Calculating the training and validation set losses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we first prepare the training and validation datasets that we will use to train the LLM later in this chapter. Then, we calculate the cross entropy for the training and validation sets, as illustrated in Figure 5.8, which is an important component of the model training process.\n",
    "Figure 5.8 After computing the cross entropy loss in the previous section, we now apply this loss computation to the entire text dataset that we will use for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the loss on the training and validation datasets as illustrated in Figure 5.8, we use a very small text dataset, the \"The Verdict\" short story by Edith Wharton, which we have already worked with in chapter 2. By selecting a text from the public domain, we circumvent any concerns related to usage rights. Additionally, the reason why we use such a small dataset is that it allows for the execution of code examples on a standard laptop computer in a matter of minutes, even without a high-end GPU, which is particularly advantageous for educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interested readers can also use the supplementary code of this book to prepare a larger-scale dataset consisting of more than 60,000 public domain books from Project Gutenberg and train an LLM on these (see appendix D for details).\n",
    "The cost of pretraining LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "To put the scale of our project into perspective, consider the training of the 7 billion parameter Llama 2 model, a relatively popular openly available LLM. This model required 184,320 GPU hours on expensive A100 GPUs, processing 2 trillion tokens. At the time of writing, running an 8xA100 cloud server on AWS costs around $30 per hour. A rough estimate puts the total training cost of such an LLM at around $690,000 (calculated as 184,320 hours divided by 8, then multiplied by $30).\n",

    "Previously, inside the generate_text_simple function, we always sampled the token with the highest probability as the next token using torch.argmax, also known as greedy decoding. To generate text with more variety, we can replace the argmax with a function that samples from a probability distribution (here, the probability scores the LLM generates for each vocabulary entry at each token generation step).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the probabilistic sampling with a concrete example, let's briefly discuss the next-token generation process using a very small vocabulary for illustration purposes:\n",

    "    \"toward\": 7,\n",
    "    \"you\": 8,\n",
    "} \n",
    "inverse_vocab = {v: k for k, v in vocab.items()}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, assume the LLM is given the start context \"every effort moves you\" and generates the following next-token logits:\n",
    "\n",
    "next_token_logits = torch.tensor(\n",
    "    [4.51, 0.89, -1.90, 6.75, 1.63, -1.62, -1.89, 6.28, 1.79]\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous chapter, Inside the generate_text_simple, we convert the logits into probabilities via the softmax function and obtain the token ID corresponding the generated token via the argmax function, which we can then map back into text via the inverse vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "probas = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=0)\n",
    "next_token_id = torch.argmax(probas).item()\n",
    "print(inverse_vocab[next_token_id])\n",
    "\n",

    "Since the largest logit value, and correspondingly the largest softmax probability score, is in the fourth position (index position 3 since Python uses 0-indexing), the generated word is \"forward\".\n",

In other words, \"forward\" is still the most likely token and will be selected by multinomial most of the time but not all the time. To illustrate this, let's implement a function that repeats this sampling 1000 times:\n",
    "\n",

    "343 x toward\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see based on the output, the word \"forward\" is sampled most of the time (582 out of 1000 times), but other tokens such as \"closer\", \"inches\", and \"toward\" will also be sampled some of the time. This means that if we replaced the argmax function with the multinomial function inside the generate_and_print_sample function, the LLM would sometimes generate texts such as \"every effort moves you toward\", \"every effort moves you inches\", and \"every effort moves you closer\" instead of \"every effort moves you forward\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further control the distribution and selection process via a concept called temperature scaling, where temperature scaling is just a fancy description for dividing the logits by a number greater than 0:\n",

    "The resulting plot is shown in Figure 5.14.\n",
    "Figure 5.14 A temperature of 1 represents the unscaled probability scores for each token in the vocabulary. Decreasing the temperature to 0.1 sharpens the distribution, so the most likely token (here \"forward\") will have an even higher probability score. Vice versa, increasing the temperature to 5 makes the distribution more uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A temperature of 1 divides the logits by 1 before passing them to the softmax function to compute the probability scores. In other words, using a temperature of 1 is the same as not using any temperature scaling. In this case, the tokens are selected with a probability equal to the original softmax probability scores via the multinomial sampling function in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the temperature setting 1, the token corresponding to \"forward\" would be selected with about 60% of the time, as we can see in Figure 5.14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as we can see in Figure 5.14, applying very small temperatures, such as 0.1, will result in sharper distributions such that the behavior of the multinomial function selects the most likely token (here: \"forward\") almost 100% of the time, approaching the behavior of the argmax function. Vice versa, a temperature of 5 results in a more uniform distribution where other tokens are selected more often. This can add more variety to the generated texts but also more often results in nonsensical text. For example, using the temperature of 5 results in texts such as \"every effort moves you pizza\" about 4% of the time.\n",

    "5.3.2 Top-k sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we implemented a probabilistic sampling approach coupled with temperature scaling to increase the diversity of the outputs. We saw that higher temperature values result in more uniformly distributed next-token probabilities, which result in more diverse outputs as it reduces the likelihood of the model repeatedly selecting the most probable token. This method allows for exploring less likely but potentially more interesting and creative paths in the generation process. However, One downside of this approach is that it sometimes leads to grammatically incorrect or completely nonsensical outputs such as \"every effort moves you pizza\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce another concept called top-k sampling, which, when combined with probabilistic sampling and temperature scaling, can improve the text generation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In top-k sampling, we can restrict the sampled tokens to the top-k most likely tokens and exclude all other tokens from the selection process by masking their probability scores, as illustrated in Figure 5.15.\n",
    "Figure 5.15 Using top-k sampling with k=3, we focus on the 3 tokens associated with the highest logits and mask out all other tokens with negative infinity (-inf) before applying the softmax function. This results in a probability distribution with a probability value 0 assigned to all non-top-k tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach outlined in Figure 5.15 replaces all non-selected logits with negative infinity value (-inf), such that when computing the softmax values, the probability scores of the non-top-k tokens are 0, and the remaining probabilities sum up to 1.

    "Top positions: tensor([3, 7, 0])\n",
