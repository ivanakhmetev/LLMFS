    "\n",
    "So far, we have discussed tokenization as an essential step in processing text as input to LLMs. Depending on the LLM, some researchers also consider additional special tokens such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [BOS] (beginning of sequence): This token marks the start of a text. It signifies to the LLM where a piece of content begins.\n",
    "    [EOS] (end of sequence): This token is positioned at the end of a text, and is especially useful when concatenating multiple unrelated texts, similar to <|endoftext|>. For instance, when combining two different Wikipedia articles or books, the [EOS] token indicates where one article ends and the next one begins.\n",
    "    [PAD] (padding): When training LLMs with batch sizes larger than one, the batch might contain texts of varying lengths. To ensure all texts have the same length, the shorter texts are extended or \"padded\" using the [PAD] token, up to the length of the longest text in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the tokenizer used for GPT models does not need any of these tokens mentioned above but only uses an <|endoftext|> token for simplicity. The <|endoftext|> is analogous to the [EOS] token mentioned above. Also, <|endoftext|> is used for padding as well. However, as we'll explore in subsequent chapters when training on batched inputs, we typically use a mask, meaning we don't attend to padded tokens. Thus, the specific token chosen for padding becomes inconsequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the tokenizer used for GPT models also doesn't use an <|unk|> token for out-of-vocabulary words. Instead, GPT models use a byte pair encoding tokenizer, which breaks down words into subword units, which we will discuss in the next section.\n"

The BPE tokenizer covered in this section was used to train LLMs such as GPT-2, GPT-3, and the original model used in ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since implementing BPE can be relatively complicated, we will use an existing Python open-source library called tiktoken (https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), which implements the BPE algorithm very efficiently based on source code in Rust. Similar to other Python libraries, we can install the tiktoken library via Python's pip installer from the terminal:\n",

    "We can make two noteworthy observations based on the token IDs and decoded text above. First, the <|endoftext|> token is assigned a relatively large token ID, namely, 50256. In fact, the BPE tokenizer, which was used to train models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, and the original model used in ChatGPT, has a total vocabulary size of 50,257, with <|endoftext|> being assigned the largest token ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the BPE tokenizer above encodes and decodes unknown words, such as \"someunknownPlace\" correctly. The BPE tokenizer can handle any unknown word. How does it achieve this without using <|unk|> tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm underlying BPE breaks down words that aren't in its predefined vocabulary into smaller subword units or even individual characters, enabling it to handle out-of-vocabulary words. So, thanks to the BPE algorithm, if the tokenizer encounters an unfamiliar word during tokenization, it can represent it as a sequence of subword tokens or characters, as illustrated in Figure 2.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.11 BPE tokenizers break down unknown words into subwords and individual characters. This way, a BPE tokenizer can parse any word and doesn't need to replace unknown words with special tokens, such as <|unk|>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Figure 2.11, the ability to break down unknown words into individual characters ensures that the tokenizer, and consequently the LLM that is trained with it, can process any text, even if it contains words that were not present in its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2.1 Byte pair encoding of unknown words\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the BPE tokenizer from the tiktoken library on the unknown words \"Akwirw ier\" and print the individual token IDs. Then, call the decode function on each of the resulting integers in this list to reproduce the mapping shown in Figure 2.11. Lastly, call the decode method on the token IDs to check whether it can reconstruct the original input, \"Akwirw ier\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed discussion and implementation of BPE is out of the scope of this book, but in short, it builds its vocabulary by iteratively merging frequent characters into subwords and frequent subwords into words. For example, BPE starts with adding all individual single characters to its vocabulary (\"a\", \"b\", ...). In the next stage, it merges character combinations that frequently occur together into subwords. For example, \"d\" and \"e\" may be merged into the subword \"de,\" which is common in many English words like \"define\", \"depend\", \"made\", and \"hidden\". The merges are determined by a frequency cutoff."

    "In the previous section, we converted the token IDs into a continuous vector representation, the so-called token embeddings. In principle, this is a suitable input for an LLM. However, a minor shortcoming of LLMs is that their self-attention mechanism, which will be covered in detail in chapter 3, doesn't have a notion of position or order for the tokens within a sequence.\n",

    "The way the previously introduced embedding layer works is that the same token ID always gets mapped to the same vector representation, regardless of where the token ID is positioned in the input sequence, as illustrated in Figure 2.17.\n",

    "Figure 2.17 The embedding layer converts a token ID into the same vector representation regardless of where it is located in the input sequence. For example, the token ID 5, whether it's in the first or third position in the token ID input vector, will result in the same embedding vector.\n",

    "In principle, the deterministic, position-independent embedding of the token ID is good for reproducibility purposes. However, since the self-attention mechanism of LLMs itself is also position-agnostic, it is helpful to inject additional position information into the LLM.\n",

    "To achieve this, there are two broad categories of position-aware embeddings: relative positional embeddings and absolute positional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute positional embeddings are directly associated with specific positions in a sequence. For each position in the input sequence, a unique embedding is added to the token's embedding to convey its exact location. For instance, the first token will have a specific positional embedding, the second token another distinct embedding, and so on, as illustrated in Figure 2.18.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of focusing on the absolute position of a token, the emphasis of relative positional embeddings is on the relative position or distance between tokens. This means the model learns the relationships in terms of \"how far apart\" rather than \"at which exact position.\" The advantage here is that the model can generalize better to sequences of varying lengths, even if it hasn't seen such lengths during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of positional embeddings aim to augment the capacity of LLMs to understand the order and relationships between tokens, ensuring more accurate and context-aware predictions. The choice between them often depends on the specific application and the nature of the data being processed.\n",

    "OpenAI's GPT models use absolute positional embeddings that are optimized during the training process rather than being fixed or predefined like the positional encodings in the original Transformer model. This optimization process is part of the model training itself, which we will implement later in this book. For now, let's create the initial positional embeddings to create the LLM inputs for the upcoming chapters.\n",

    "    LLMs require textual data to be converted into numerical vectors, known as embeddings since they can't process raw text. Embeddings transform discrete data (like words or images) into continuous vector spaces, making them compatible with neural network operations.\n",
    "    As the first step, raw text is broken into tokens, which can be words or characters. Then, the tokens are converted into integer representations, termed token IDs.\n",
    "    Special tokens, such as <|unk|> and <|endoftext|>, can be added to enhance the model's understanding and handle various contexts, such as unknown words or marking the boundary between unrelated texts.\n",
    "    The byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer used for LLMs like GPT-2 and GPT-3 can efficiently handle unknown words by breaking them down into subword units or individual characters.\n",
    "    We use a sliding window approach on tokenized data to generate input-target pairs for LLM training.\n",
    "    Embedding layers in PyTorch function as a lookup operation, retrieving vectors corresponding to token IDs. The resulting embedding vectors provide continuous representations of tokens, which is crucial for training deep learning models like LLMs.\n",
    "    While token embeddings provide consistent vector representations for each token, they lack a sense of the token's position in a sequence. To rectify this, two main types of positional embeddings exist: absolute and relative. OpenAI's GPT models utilize absolute positional embeddings that are added to the token embedding vectors and are optimized during the model training.\n"
